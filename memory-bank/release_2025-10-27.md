## CMS-AI-Zkończenie — Release 2025-10-27

### Status
- Build complete and frozen.
- Compliance: PASS (pure PHP, FTP-only, require_once; UTF-8 no BOM; no closing "?>"; unified `Core\*` namespaces; DEV/PROD gates OK; CSRF on all POST forms).

### Highlights
- Router unified at `/core/router.php` with `Core\Router`.
- ControllerRegistry integrated and namespaced.
- ThemeManager renders homepage via layout; fallback safe without DB.
- SettingsModel guarded with try/catch (stable without tables).
- Legacy files removed (`/Router.php`, `/cache/Cache.php`, `/includes/Security/csrf.php`, adapter stubs).

### Verification
- Logs clean (no homepage fatals).
- Forbidden calls: none.
- Closing tag at EOF: none.
- Encoding: UTF-8 no BOM; single trailing newline.

### Next Steps (Post-Release)
1. Keep DEV endpoints gated in production.
2. Prepare packaging/export script externally (manual FTP bundle).
3. Monitor logs for 48h and tag hotfixes if needed.
