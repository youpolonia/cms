Over the past decade, I've had the privilege of working with editorial clients, galleries, and private collectors worldwide.</p><p>My approach is patient and observational. I believe the best photographs aren't taken — they're discovered. Whether working in the studio or on location, I seek moments of authentic beauty and quiet power.</p><p>My work has been featured in The New York Times, Vogue, National Geographic, and exhibited at galleries in New York, London, Paris, and Tokyo.</p>",
