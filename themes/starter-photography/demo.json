Each frame is guided by a simple philosophy: <em>show the world as it deserves to be seen.</em></p><h2>Approach</h2><p>I work primarily with natural light, preferring the honesty it brings to every subject. Whether it's a portrait session in a dimly lit studio or a landscape shoot at golden hour, I chase the moments that feel both fleeting and eternal.</p><p>Every project begins with a conversation — understanding your vision, your story, the emotion you want to convey. From there, I disappear behind the camera and let the magic happen.</p><h2>Recognition</h2><p>Featured in The Guardian, National Geographic Traveller, British Journal of Photography, and Vogue Italia. Winner of the Sony World Photography Award (Open Category, 2023).</p>",

The goal was to strip away everything except the essential relationship between the human face and light itself.</p><p>The results speak to something timeless. Without colour, without context, what remains is expression — the architecture of a face revealed through shadow.</p><blockquote>\"In darkness, we find what light alone cannot reveal.\"</blockquote><p>The series was exhibited at The Photographers' Gallery, London, and published in the British Journal of Photography's annual edition.</p>",
