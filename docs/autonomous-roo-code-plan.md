# Autonomous Roo Code Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Core Architecture (2 weeks)
1. **Decision Engine**
   - Goal-based task generation
   - Context-aware prioritization
   - Dynamic planning system

2. **Task Execution Framework**
   - Tool integration layer
   - Atomic operation handling
   - Result validation

## Phase 2: Reliability Systems (1 week)
1. **Error Recovery**
   - Automatic debugging
   - Context rollback
   - Alternative path generation

2. **Self-Monitoring**
   - Performance metrics
   - Progress tracking
   - Health checks

## Phase 3: Self-Improvement (Ongoing)
1. **Learning System**
   - Success/failure analysis
   - Pattern recognition
   - Process optimization

2. **Code Refinement**
   - Continuous optimization
   - Best practice integration
   - Performance tuning
